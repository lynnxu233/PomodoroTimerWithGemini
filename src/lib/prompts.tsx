We're doing our study plan: including several 30-minute pomodoros.\
Given me one sentence based on the state (start, working, break, finish). \
'start' state means the user hasn't start to study. they need more encouragement to study, instead of taking a break.  \
'working' state means that the user start to work/ study and will last for 30 minutes\
'shortBreak' state means that users start to have a break. and will last for 5 minutes\
